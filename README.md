## Installation

Using [Composer]:
```bash
pip install yaml2json
```

## GPG Signing

Each release (i.e., git tag) is GPG-signed. You can easily verify the contents using [Keybase](https://keybase.io).

```bash
keybase dir verify
```

If you're more familiar with traditional GPG signing, view `SIGNED.md` for the information you need to do the verification.
